            <h4>Library Management System</h4>
            <p >
              The Library Management System is a Java-based project that utilizes Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to efficiently manage books, users, and borrowing records. It allows users to add, remove, and search for books using optimized algorithms like HashMaps and Trees. The system maintains user details, tracks book issuance and returns, and ensures seamless management of due dates. With efficient searching and sorting techniques such as Binary Search and Hashing, book retrieval is fast and accurate. Data persistence is achieved through file handling or database integration, making the system scalable and practical for real-world applications. This project showcases the power of Java and DSA in solving real-world management problems effectively.
